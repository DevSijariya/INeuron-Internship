Problem Statement:
The main goal of this project is to perform extensive Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) on
the Zomato Dataset and build an appropriate Machine Learning Model that will help
various Zomato Restaurants to predict their respective Ratings based on certain
features.

Approach: The classical machine learning tasks like Data Exploration, Data Cleaning,
Feature Engineering, Model Building and Model Testing. Try out different machine
learning algorithms that’s best fit for the above case.

Results: You have to build a solution that should able to predict the ratings of the
restaurants listed in the dataset.

• You are supposed to write a code in a modular fashion
• Safe: It can be used without causing harm.
• Testable: It can be tested at the code level.
• Maintainable: It can be maintained, even as your codebase grows.
• Portable: It works the same in every environment (operating system)
• You have to maintain your code on GitHub.
• You have to keep your GitHub repo public so that anyone can check your code.
• Proper readme file you have to maintain for any project development.
• You should include basic workflow and execution of the entire project in the readme
file on GitHub
• Follow the coding standards: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/

Database:
• You are supposed to use a given dataset for this project which is a Cassandra
database.
• https://astra.dev/ineuron

Cloud:
• You can use any cloud platform for this entire solution hosting like AWS, Azure or
GCP
API Details or User Interface:
• You have to expose your complete solution as an API or try to create a user
interface for your model testing. Anything will be fine for us.
Logging:
• Logging is a must for every action performed by your code use the python logging
library for this.
Ops Pipeline:
• If possible, you can try to use AI ops pipeline for project delivery Ex. DVC, MLflow
, Sagemaker , Azure machine learning studio, Jenkins, Circle CI, Azure DevOps ,
TFX, Travis CI

Deployment:
• You can host your model in the cloud platform, edge devices, or maybe local, but
with a proper justification of your system design.

3

Solutions Design:
• You have to submit complete solution design strategies in HLD and LLD document
System Architecture:
• You have to submit a system architecture design in your wireframe document and
architecture document.
Latency for model response:
• You have to measure the response time of your model for a particular input of a
dataset.
Optimization of solutions:
• Try to optimize your solution on code level, architecture level and mention all of
these things in your final submission.
• Mention your test cases for your project.
